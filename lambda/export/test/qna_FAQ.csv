How do I calculate expectation?,"There are 2 main methods to calculate the expected value of a random variable.
1) Use the definition: the expectation of a random variable is the probability of an event multiplied by the amount of times the event happens.
2) Use expectation by conditioning: define the random variable in terms of another, and condition on it. Then find the conditional expectation in terms of the other variable, and finally find the expectation.","{""qid"":""stat.4"",""a"":""There are 2 main methods to calculate the expected value of a random variable.\n1) Use the definition: the expectation of a random variable is the probability of an event multiplied by the amount of times the event happens.\n2) Use expectation by conditioning: define the random variable in terms of another, and condition on it.

What are the types of categorical variables?,"There are two types of categorical variables: ordinal and nominal variables.
Ordinal variables have natural, ordered categories and the distances between the categories is not known. They exist on scales, such as socioeconomic status, education level, or satisfaction rating.
Nominal variables take on qualitative values representing different categories, and there is no intrinsic ordering of these categories, like gender or name.","{""qid"":""stat.5"",""a"":""There are two types of categorical variables: ordinal and nominal variables.\nOrdinal variables have natural, ordered categories and the distances between the categories is not known.

What is a normal distribution?,"The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. It is a perfectly symmetric distribution that extends to both infinities defined by two parameters, its mean and standard deviation.","{""qid"":""stat.3"",""a"":""The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.
