{"a":" As the point of arrival for the railroad, the hillside west of the Prairie Line corridor hosted many ethnic enclaves, including the Nihonmachi, or Japan Town.

Building this more direct route over the Cascades was what made Tacoma finally boom.\n\n As the city grew up, so did the Nihonmachi.

{"a":" The real boom came after the NPRR completed the Stampede Pass tunnel, a direct route that cut through the mountains of the Cascades to Eastern Washington. By 1890, Tacoma was 36,000 strong.\n\n The Cascade Branch met the Prairie Line at South 15th Street, bringing with it Tacoma's first major surge of passenger traffic. The next wave of newcomers, many of them immigrants, poured into Tacoma. Ethnic enclaves took root in Old Town and west of the Prairie Line on the hill overlooking Commencement Bay. Swedes, Germans, Danes, Italians, Norwegians, Greeks, and Croatians grouped together to ease their transition to America and preserve their culture. Japanese immigrants, arriving by ship, also settled near the rail line, opening hotels and other businesses and creating the Nihonmachi, or Japan Town neighborhood. Many African-Americans who arrived in Tacoma worked for the railroad, and some settled up the hill in a neighborhood that would become known as Hilltop.\n\n In 1911, Union Station replaced the passenger depot on South 17th Street, creating a formal railroad terminal for passengers arriving in Tacoma.

{"a":" Shipment to China was created to commemorate the Chinese laborers who were instrumental in building the transcontinental railroad in the United States.

In addition to dangerous, sometimes fatal working conditions, many Chinese laborers were threatened and killed during anti-Chinese expulsion movements.\n\nAfter a Chinese worker died, the ashes of the deceased were often sent back to China in boxes, so that they could be buried next to their ancestors.  This piece refers to that practice.  Each box represents a worker.  The majority of boxes are anonymous; however a few choice names and dates powerfully connect us to the past and the people who gave their lives to build the railroad and the West.\n\nAfter connecting the city to the nation by building the Northern Pacific Railroad (NPRR), many Chinese workers settled in the growing city. But national sentiment began to turn against these immigrants, and in Tacoma, the Chinese community was intentionally expelled after anti-Chinese sentiment turned violent.  Led by Tacoma's Mayor, the Chinese community of 600 was driven out of town on November 3, 1885. After the riot, the Chinese District, sometimes called Little Canton, lay in smoldering ruins. This horrific event, and the complicit role of the City's leaders, led this kind of expulsion to be known as the Tacoma Method nation-wide.","qid":"Shipment to China: About the art","t":"Shipment to China","alt":{"markdown":" Shipment to China was created to commemorate the Chinese laborers who were instrumental in building the transcontinental railroad in the United States.

{"a":" As the point of arrival for the railroad, the hillside west of the Prairie Line corridor hosted many ethnic enclaves, including the Nihonmachi, or Japan Town. By 1890, approximately 500 Japanese-Americans lived in Tacoma. Arriving by ship, many Japanese first came to work in railroad construction. In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific enlisted Hifumi Harry Kumamoto to recruit 2,000 Japanese laborers to help build the Cascade Branch of the NPRR. Building this more direct route over the Cascades was what made Tacoma finally boom.\n\n As the city grew up, so did the Nihonmachi. Japanese entrepreneurs like Fujimatsu and Sadako Moriguchi set up shop. Established in 1928, their store  Uwajima-ya  sold Japanese staples to countrymen craving a bit of home.\n\n The Japanese Language School, Nihongo Gakko, served as the main hub of Japan Town. From 1911 through 1942, the school brought the families of a thriving urban neighborhood together to support the future of their community and their children. The school was located on the 1700 block of Tacoma Avenue in a bustling neighborhood of hotels, restaurants, laundries, banks, and houses. For three decades, the school instilled in its young students the moral and cultural values of their Japanese heritage, and also emphasized a strong commitment to American citizenship.","qid":"Maru: Historical Context","t":"Maru","alt":{"markdown":" As the point of arrival for the railroad, the hillside west of the Prairie Line corridor hosted many ethnic enclaves, including the Nihonmachi, or Japan Town.
